For example, in the file path `my_data/*.csv`, the wildcard `*` will help us select all files, regardless of their names, that end up with `.csv`. In contrast, the `os.path.join()` below helps us connect different directories together regardless of the operating system."

    "One of the best features of Dask is that it allows you to scale regular Python code for data analysis to either fully use all of the resources in your machine or to scale your computations to a cluster of machines. Dask does this by integrating itself with some of the most well known tools in the data analytics domain such as pandas, NumPy, SciKit-Learn, its own dask bags which are great for processing large unstructured files, and many more. In addition, it allows you to create your own parallelised workflow with a useful function called `delayed()` that lazily starts building up a paralellised computational graph.\n",

You might remember this order of operations from your high school days, where your math teacher would tell you that parentheses always come firt, followed by the exponents, then the multiplication, the division, the addition and the subtraction when doing operations. We will follow this pemdas order of operations with the pandas Series of a toy dataframe."
